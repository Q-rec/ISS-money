By collecting many sources, it grows an overview.\r\nEspecially the russian part was pretty difficult, because they only publish a rare amount of numbers.\r\nI wanted to create a poster. In order to make a data visualization i used different styles, as seen in the finished work. As you can quickly spot, the money spend has huge differences between countries, so i tried to set the money spend in connection with the persons who visited the ISS by countries. Calculated is the average money spend one person at ISS 700.000.000$. At the right it shows, what you could buy instead. And at the bottom right, who could afford it.\r\n\r\nThe colors concerning of the Cosmos, or the earth „the blue planet“. The logo on top is drawing of the ISS. The poster was made completely in Adobe Illustrator.\r\n\r\n![poster](https://github.com/Q-rec/ISS-money/blob/master/images/ISS.png)\r\n",
